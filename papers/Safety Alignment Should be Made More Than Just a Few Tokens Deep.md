## Core Hypothesis
- **Main Argument:** Current safety alignment techniques for large language models (LLMs) primarily adjust the distribution of the *first few tokens* in a model's response.
- **Problem:** Attackers exploit this shallow safety alignment by manipulating the initial tokens, bypassing safeguards and allowing the base language model to generate harmful or undesired content.

## Types of Attacks Discussed
1. **Prefilling Attacks:**  
   - Attackers prefill the initial response tokens (e.g., "Of course") to set the model on a path that leads to harmful outputs.
   - Exploited in Open-source LLMs where initial response tokens can be controlled.

2. **Random Sampling Attacks:**  
   - Repeatedly sampling from the model’s output distribution until a desired (non-aligned) response emerges.
   - After achieving the desired first few tokens, the rest of the harmful response follows naturally.

3. **Optimization-Based Attacks:**  
   - Automated generation of prompts to elicit affirmative prefixes (e.g., "Sure, here is").
   - Focuses on maximizing the likelihood of specific prefixes instead of the full response.

4. **Fine-Tuning Attacks:**  
   - Fine-tuning an aligned model with harmful data to override its safety mechanisms.
   - Primarily affects the first few tokens, leaving the rest of the response largely unaffected.

## Findings and Experiments
1. **Shallow Alignment Mechanism:**  
   - Safety alignment creates significant divergence between aligned and unaligned models only in the first tokens.
   - The rest of the response remains consistent, making attacks focused on initial tokens highly effective.

2. **Gradient and Loss Distribution:**  
   - Safety alignment during fine-tuning primarily alters gradients and loss in the first tokens.
   - Fine-tuning attacks exploit this by targeting the first few tokens.

3. **Defensive Techniques Explored:**  
   - **Refusal Data Augmentation:** Introduced refusal patterns that switch mid-response (e.g., "Yes... actually, no") to strengthen alignment. However, attackers can adapt easily.
   - **Parameterized Loss Functions:** Developed a loss function that penalizes divergence in the first few tokens but allows flexibility in later tokens. This introduces trade-offs by limiting valid use cases.

## Key Challenges
- **Persistent Harmful Capabilities:**  
  - Harmful capabilities are inherent to LLMs because "harmful" outputs often result from recontextualizing benign knowledge (e.g., using a kitchen knife safely vs. harmfully).

- **Attack Adaptability:**  
  - Attackers can easily adapt to new defenses, such as introducing patterns that reverse the alignment (e.g., "first refuse, then comply").

- **Limitations of Current Fine-Tuning:**  
  - Fine-tuning suppresses certain paths in the language model’s generation tree but does not fundamentally alter the underlying generative distribution.

---

## Potential Solutions
   - **External Classifiers:** Use external systems to monitor and halt harmful outputs. However, this limits the model’s ability to explain refusals.  
   - **Contextual Awareness:** Develop systems that integrate broader contextual checks instead of focusing solely on token-level alignment.
